# Internet of Things ( IoT )
For IoT we will use the **Arduino IDE.**
## What we need to do 
1. We have to make proper connection of all the sensors to our **NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi module.**
2. We need to code in Arduino IDE to fetch data from sensor.
3. We need to code in Arduino IDE to **send the data to Firebase using NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi module.**

## How will we achieve all this 
1. First we have to learn in depth about the **NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi Module.**[CLick here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YoyF1-Ff1w)
2. Then we should have knowledge of all the sensors we are using.
3. DHT-11 HUmidity and Temperature sensor.[Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYa_4rh0-w)
4. Soil moisture sensor.[Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_jfj4Krj7M) and [Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3beP0ANNUjQ)
5. Rain drop sensor.[Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUxfutrcNUQ) and [Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtqtMLmRqZI)
    


**THATS IT. WE DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING EXTRA. WE ONLY NEED TO SEND THE DATA TO FIREBASE CONTINUOUSLY.**
