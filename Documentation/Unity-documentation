# Unity & Augmented Reality
Unity and AR is used to make a scene which will scan an image target and shows the data collected from IoT sensors. [Click here to see and example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMfaTxV62LE&list=PL_Nji0JOuXg2M9VkBd4LWThmowzlz44Et&index=8)

## What we need to do 

1. Make an AR scene to show all our sensors' data just like in the above demo video.[Click here to see again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMfaTxV62LE&list=PL_Nji0JOuXg2M9VkBd4LWThmowzlz44Et&index=8)
2. Connect this AR scene with the Flutter app made.

## How will we achieve all this 
1. Learn environment of Unity. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FrI693wGE0IXu4cKIeJa6yLAnTONGAnm27rftsZO_Q/edit?usp=sharing) and then [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZpJzpE2lQ)
2. Learn Vuforia. [Click here to learn](https://augmentedtutorials.blogspot.com/2020/07/your-fist-augmented-reality.html) and then [click here to make a small game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeiHtFp2E2c)
3. Learn to make UI in Vuforia. [Click here to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHliig-W-g). The video is very old so don't follow the video blindly as it is very different from now.
3. Learn how to fetch data from Firebase to Unity. **Link will be updated soon.**

**THATS IT. WE DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING EXTRA. WE ONLY NEED TO FETCH THE DATA FROM FIREBASE CONTINUOUSLY.**
